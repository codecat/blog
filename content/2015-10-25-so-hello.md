Hooray!

<!-- more -->

Here I will be posting things that I deem worthy‚Ä¶ or, at least, that I find interesting. Things about programming, game development and design, progress updates on projects that I am doing. I also maintain the developer blog for Serious Sam Revolution sometimes, so if you‚Äôre curious as to what kind of things I will write here, check out an example developer blog!

Oh yeah, and this thing is powered by ~~Anchor CMS~~ ~~WordPress. I caved in. üôÅ~~ [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/)! It's pretty neat.

Now don‚Äôt expect me to post things here all that often, since you will probably see more posts by me on the Serious Sam Revolution developer blog than on here, but I still like to write some things every now and then.

Hmm, so you‚Äôve read this post all the way to the end, huh? Congratulations! You win a cookie! Enjoy the cookie.
